# Quality Assurance Process

## Overview

This document outlines the Quality Assurance (QA) process for the SmartRent project. The QA process ensures that all code changes meet the quality standards defined in the [testing standards](./testing-standards.md) and [metrics](./metrics.md) documents.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Developers

- Write high-quality code that adheres to project standards
- Write comprehensive tests for all new code
- Run automated checks locally before pushing code
- Review code from other team members
- Address QA feedback

### Tech Leads

- Ensure the team follows the QA process
- Provide technical guidance on quality issues
- Review and approve code with significant architectural impact
- Make final decisions on technical disagreements

### QA Engineers

- Review test coverage and suggest improvements
- Perform manual testing when necessary
- Verify bug fixes and feature implementations
- Maintain QA documentation
- Monitor quality metrics and report trends

## QA Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase

- Define quality requirements for new features
- Identify potential risks and edge cases
- Create test plans for complex features
- Review architectural decisions for quality impact

### 2. Development Phase

- Follow the [code style guidelines](../contributing/code-style.md)
- Write unit tests for all new code
- Run tests locally before pushing changes
- Use pre-commit hooks to catch issues early

### 3. Code Review Phase

- Follow the [code review guidelines](./code-review.md)
- Check that code meets quality standards
- Verify test coverage is adequate
- Ensure documentation is complete and accurate

### 4. Testing Phase

- Run the full test suite in CI environment
- Perform manual testing for UI/UX features
- Execute integration tests
- For critical features, perform exploratory testing

### 5. Deployment Phase

- Verify build artifacts
- Run smoke tests in staging environment
- Check for performance regressions
- Monitor the deployment for issues

### 6. Maintenance Phase

- Monitor application performance and errors
- Address reported bugs according to priority
- Regularly update dependencies
- Perform periodic code quality reviews

## Quality Gates

### Feature Development Quality Gates

1. **Planning Approval**
   - Feature requirements are clear
   - Test cases are defined
   - Risks are identified

2. **Code Review Approval**
   - Code meets style guidelines
   - Tests are comprehensive
   - Documentation is complete

3. **QA Approval**
   - All automated tests pass
   - Manual testing is complete
   - No critical or high severity issues

4. **Deployment Approval**
   - Smoke tests pass in staging
   - Performance meets requirements
   - Security checks pass

### Bug Fix Quality Gates

1. **Issue Verification**
   - Bug is reproducible
   - Root cause is identified

2. **Fix Verification**
   - Fix addresses the root cause
   - Fix does not introduce new issues
   - Tests are added to prevent regression

3. **QA Approval**
   - Fix resolves the issue
   - Regression tests pass
   - No new issues are introduced

## Issue Prioritization

| Priority | Description | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| P0 - Critical | Production system down, severe impact on users | Immediate | < 24 hours |
| P1 - High | Major functionality broken, significant user impact | < 4 hours | < 48 hours |
| P2 - Medium | Non-critical functionality affected | < 24 hours | < 1 week |
| P3 - Low | Minor issues, minimal user impact | < 3 days | Backlog |

## Test Environment Management

### Development Environment

- Local environment for developer testing
- Mocked external dependencies
- Refreshed with each pull request

### Integration Environment

- Shared environment for integration testing
- Connected to test instances of external services
- Refreshed daily

### Staging Environment

- Production-like environment for final testing
- Uses replicated production data (anonymized)
- Refreshed before each release

## Release Quality Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass in staging environment
- [ ] Test coverage meets minimum thresholds
- [ ] No critical or high severity bugs open
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Release notes are prepared

## Quality Improvement Process

1. **Collect Metrics**
   - Track quality metrics over time
   - Gather feedback from users and team members

2. **Analyze Trends**
   - Identify recurring issues
   - Determine root causes

3. **Create Action Plan**
   - Define specific improvements
   - Assign responsibility
   - Set measurable goals

4. **Implement Changes**
   - Update processes
   - Provide training
   - Improve tooling

5. **Measure Impact**
   - Compare metrics before and after changes
   - Gather feedback on process changes
   - Refine as needed

## Incident Response

1. **Detect**: Identify the issue through monitoring or user reports
2. **Respond**: Assign the issue to the appropriate team member
3. **Mitigate**: Apply temporary fix if possible
4. **Resolve**: Implement permanent solution
5. **Learn**: Conduct post-mortem and document lessons learned
6. **Prevent**: Implement measures to prevent similar issues
