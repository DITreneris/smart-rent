# Quality Metrics

## Overview

This document outlines the quality metrics tracked in the SmartRent project. These metrics are used to measure code quality, test coverage, and overall project health.

## Code Quality Metrics

### Code Complexity

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | Measures the complexity of code by counting the number of independent paths through a program's source code | < 10 per function |
| Cognitive Complexity | Measures how difficult it is to understand the code | < 15 per function |
| Function Length | Number of lines in a function | < 50 lines |
| File Length | Number of lines in a file | < 500 lines |
| Function Parameter Count | Number of parameters in a function | â‰¤ 5 parameters |

### Code Duplication

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Duplication Percentage | Percentage of code that appears to be duplicated | < 3% |
| Duplicate Blocks | Number of duplicate code blocks | Minimize |

### Code Style

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Style Violations | Number of style guide violations | 0 |
| Documentation Coverage | Percentage of public API with documentation | > 80% |
| Comment Ratio | Percentage of comments to code | 10-30% |

## Test Metrics

### Coverage

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Line Coverage | Percentage of lines executed during tests | > 80% (Backend)<br>> 70% (Frontend)<br>100% (Smart Contracts) |
| Branch Coverage | Percentage of branches executed during tests | > 75% |
| Function Coverage | Percentage of functions called during tests | > 85% |

### Test Quality

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Test Success Rate | Percentage of tests that pass | 100% |
| Test Execution Time | Time to execute the test suite | < 5 minutes |
| Flaky Tests | Number of tests with inconsistent results | 0 |

## Maintainability Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Maintainability Index | Calculated value between 0 and 100 that represents the relative ease of maintaining the code | > 70 |
| Technical Debt Ratio | Ratio of the cost to fix all maintainability issues to the cost of developing the application from scratch | < 5% |
| Issue Density | Number of issues per 1000 lines of code | < 2 |

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Response Time | Average response time for API endpoints | < 300ms |
| Database Query Time | Average time for database queries | < 100ms |
| Smart Contract Gas Usage | Gas used by smart contract functions | Optimize based on function |

## Security Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Security Vulnerabilities | Number of identified security vulnerabilities | 0 |
| OWASP Top 10 Compliance | Compliance with OWASP Top 10 security risks | 100% |
| Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities | Number of dependencies with known vulnerabilities | 0 |

## Tracking and Reporting

### Tools Used

- **SonarCloud**: Main quality metrics tracking
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline metrics
- **pytest-cov**: Python test coverage
- **Jest coverage**: JavaScript/TypeScript test coverage
- **solidity-coverage**: Smart contract test coverage

### Dashboards

- **SonarCloud Dashboard**: Main quality metrics dashboard
- **GitHub Insights**: Contribution statistics
- **Test Coverage Reports**: Generated during CI builds

### Review Process

1. **Daily**: Developers check metrics for their own code
2. **Weekly**: Team review of overall metrics
3. **Monthly**: Comprehensive quality review with stakeholders

## Continuous Improvement

Quality metrics are not just for monitoring but also for driving continuous improvement:

1. Identify areas with poor metrics
2. Analyze root causes
3. Develop improvement plans
4. Implement changes
5. Monitor results and adjust as needed

## Reference Values

### Maintainability Index

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 0-9   | Very low maintainability |
| 10-19 | Low maintainability |
| 20-49 | Moderate maintainability |
| 50-79 | Good maintainability |
| 80-100 | Excellent maintainability |

### Cyclomatic Complexity

| Score | Risk Level |
|-------|------------|
| 1-10  | Low risk - simple program, no issues |
| 11-20 | Moderate risk - more complex, moderate risk |
| 21-50 | High risk - complex, high risk |
| 50+   | Very high risk - untestable code, very high risk |
