# Test Strategy Document

This document outlines the strategy for expanding test coverage in the SmartRent platform to ensure comprehensive quality assurance.

## Current Test Coverage

The platform currently has several test modules covering basic functionality:

- **Authentication**: User registration, login, profiles (`test_auth.py`)
- **Properties**: Property listing and management (`test_properties.py`)
- **Contracts**: Rental contract operations (`test_contracts.py`)
- **Admin**: Admin functionalities (`test_admin.py`)
- **Blockchain**: Blockchain integration services (`test_blockchain.py`)
- **Main**: Application-wide functionality like CORS (`test_main.py`)

## Test Coverage Goals

For the SmartRent platform, we've established the following coverage targets:

- **Backend**: 80% line coverage
- **Frontend**: 70% line coverage
- **Smart Contracts**: 100% line coverage

## Test Expansion Plan

### 1. Identify Coverage Gaps

Before writing new tests, we will:

1. Generate comprehensive coverage reports using `pytest-cov`
2. Analyze uncovered code paths
3. Prioritize modules with the lowest coverage or highest business impact

### 2. Backend Test Expansion

#### Model Tests

Every model in the application should have corresponding unit tests that verify:

- Object creation with valid data
- Validation logic
- Relationship behavior
- Special methods (if any)

**Priority Models**:
- User
- Property
- Contract
- Proposal
- Document

#### Service Layer Tests

The service layer should have isolated unit tests that:

- Mock database dependencies
- Test business logic independently
- Verify error handling

**Priority Services**:
- User service
- Property service
- Contract service
- Blockchain service
- Document service

#### API Endpoint Tests

Extend existing API tests to cover:

- All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Authorization rules
- Input validation
- Error responses
- Edge cases

**Priority Endpoints**:
- `/api/users/*`
- `/api/properties/*`
- `/api/contracts/*`
- `/api/proposals/*`
- `/api/documents/*`
- `/api/payments/*`

#### Utility Function Tests

Create dedicated tests for utility functions in:

- `app/core`
- `app/utils`
- Helper functions

### 3. MongoDB Integration Tests

Since the application uses MongoDB:

1. Create fixtures for MongoDB testing using an in-memory MongoDB instance or containerized MongoDB
2. Test database schema validation
3. Verify query performance
4. Test index usage

### 4. Test Implementation Approach

When implementing new tests, follow these principles:

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should run independently
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, action, and verification
3. **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive function names like `test_user_login_with_valid_credentials()`
4. **Parameterization**: Use pytest's parameterize for testing multiple cases
5. **Mocking**: Use appropriate mocking for external dependencies

### 5. Test Organization

Organize tests following the application's structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/                  # Unit tests targeting isolated components
│   ├── models/            # Tests for data models
│   ├── services/          # Tests for service layer 
│   └── utils/             # Tests for utility functions
├── integration/           # Tests involving multiple components
│   ├── api/               # API endpoint tests
│   └── db/                # Database integration tests
├── e2e/                   # End-to-end tests for complete flows
└── conftest.py            # Shared fixtures
```

### 6. Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Unit Test Expansion

1. Create a new test directory structure
2. Set up MongoDB test fixtures
3. Implement unit tests for models
4. Implement unit tests for services
5. Implement unit tests for utilities

#### Phase 2: Integration Test Expansion

1. Expand API endpoint tests
2. Implement database integration tests
3. Test authentication flows

#### Phase 3: E2E and Special Case Testing

1. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
2. Add performance tests
3. Implement security-focused tests

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Setup and Unit Tests

- Day 1-2: Set up test directory structure and MongoDB test fixtures
- Day 3-5: Implement unit tests for models and core services

### Week 2: Integration Tests

- Day 6-7: Expand API endpoint tests
- Day 8-10: Implement integration tests for critical flows

## Test Maintenance Strategy

- **Continuous Integration**: All tests will run on each pull request
- **Coverage Reporting**: Generate coverage reports for each test run
- **Test Debt**: Address failing tests immediately
- **Test Reviews**: Include test review in the code review process

## Tools

- **pytest**: Main testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking library
- **mongomock**: MongoDB mocking
- **pytest-mongodb**: MongoDB fixtures for testing

## Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Write tests before implementing new features
2. **No Production Dependencies**: Tests should never depend on external services
3. **Reproducible**: Tests should yield the same results on every run
4. **Fast Execution**: Optimize tests to run quickly
5. **Clear Failures**: Test failures should clearly indicate what failed and why
