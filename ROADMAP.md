## MVP Roadmap (Targeting v0.6.0 - v0.6.x)

**Goal:** Deliver a stable, minimal viable product demonstrating the core rental flow on a simplified tech stack (React, FastAPI (`app`), MongoDB, minimal EVM/Solidity) for investor readiness.

**Key Phases (Aligned with `morning_ses1.md`):**

### Phase 1: Consolidation & Simplification (Target: Sprint 1-2)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Consolidate Backend:** Delete `backend/app`, migrate necessary logic to `app`. (Requires manual deletion first)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Update Documentation:** Align `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md` with MVP scope and stack (Remove Solana/Hyperledger). (In Progress)
- â¬œ **Define MVP Rental Flow:** Finalize core process (Propose -> Accept -> Confirm) and on-chain role (Team Workshop Needed).
- â¬œ **Simplify Smart Contract:** Refactor `SmartRent.sol` based on defined MVP flow (metadata anchor / simple events).
- â¬œ **Verify Core Connections:** Ensure Frontend <-> Backend (`app`) API communication works.
- â¬œ **Verify Docker:** Confirm `docker-compose.yml` builds and runs the simplified stack.

### Phase 2: Core MVP Feature Implementation (Target: Sprint 3-5)
- â¬œ **Implement Core Rental Flow:** Build UI components and backend logic for:
    - Tenant: View properties, propose rental.
    - Landlord: View proposals, accept rental.
    - System: Update state (DB primarily, minimal contract interaction if defined).
- â¬œ **Implement Basic Dashboard:** View relevant properties/rentals for logged-in user.
- â¬œ **Implement Essential Backend Services:** Robust services in `app/services` for property/rental management.
- â¬œ **Implement Basic On-Chain Interaction:** If defined in flow (e.g., read metadata, emit event).
- â¬œ **Implement Basic Transaction Monitoring:** Off-chain monitoring for essential steps (if needed).
- â¬œ **Implement Essential Security:** Input validation, auth middleware checks.

### Phase 3: Testing & Stabilization (Target: Sprint 6-7)
- â¬œ **Core Flow Integration Tests:** Frontend <-> Backend <-> DB tests for rental process.
- â¬œ **Essential Unit Tests:** Critical backend services, utils, key frontend components.
- â¬œ **Basic Smart Contract Tests:** If contract has logic/events.
- â¬œ **Manual Testing & Bug Fixing:** Ensure MVP stability.
- â¬œ **Logging & Error Handling:** Verify adequacy for troubleshooting.
- â¬œ **Deployment Prep:** Finalize scripts/documentation for MVP deployment.
