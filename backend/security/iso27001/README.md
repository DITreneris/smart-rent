- **`risk_assessment/`**: Contains risk assessment methodology and results
- **`controls/`**: Contains implementation details for security controls
- **`documentation/`**: Contains overall ISMS documentation including roadmap and plans
- **`standards/`**: Contains technical standards and requirements for security controls
- **`procedures/`**: Contains procedural documents that detail specific processes
