# ISO 27001 Gap Analysis: Current State Assessment

## Overview

This document presents the initial gap analysis for ISO 27001 compliance at SmartRent. The purpose is to identify the current security posture of the organization, identify gaps in the information security management system (ISMS), and serve as a foundation for developing a roadmap to ISO 27001 certification.

## Assessment Scope

The scope of this gap analysis covers:

- SmartRent platform and associated services
- Development environments and processes
- Data storage and processing systems
- Internal networks and access controls
- Third-party integrations
- Personnel security awareness and practices

## Assessment Methodology

This assessment is conducted using:

1. Documentation review
2. Interviews with key stakeholders
3. Technical testing and configuration reviews
4. Comparison against ISO 27001:2013 requirements
5. Risk assessment of identified gaps

## ISO 27001 Controls Assessment

| Control Domain | Control Objective | Current State | Gap | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|-----|------------|----------------|
| A.5 Information Security Policies | A.5.1 Management direction for information security | Partial information security policies exist but are not comprehensive | No formal information security policy framework | High | Develop comprehensive information security policy aligned with ISO 27001 |
| A.6 Organization of Information Security | A.6.1 Internal organization | Roles exist but not formally defined for security | Lack of formal security roles and responsibilities | Medium | Define and document security roles and responsibilities |
| A.7 Human Resource Security | A.7.1 Prior to employment | Limited security screening for new hires | Inconsistent pre-employment screening | Medium | Establish formal pre-employment screening process |
| A.8 Asset Management | A.8.1 Responsibility for assets | No formal asset inventory maintained | Lack of asset inventory and classification | High | Implement asset management system with classification |
| A.9 Access Control | A.9.1 Business requirements for access control | Basic access controls implemented | Incomplete access control policies | Medium | Develop comprehensive access control policies |
| A.10 Cryptography | A.10.1 Cryptographic controls | Some encryption in place but not standardized | Inconsistent cryptographic implementation | High | Develop cryptographic policy and standards |
| A.11 Physical and Environmental Security | A.11.1 Secure areas | Limited physical security controls | Incomplete physical security measures | Medium | Enhance physical security controls |
| A.12 Operations Security | A.12.1 Operational procedures and responsibilities | Some documented procedures | Incomplete operational security procedures | Medium | Develop comprehensive operational security procedures |
| A.13 Communications Security | A.13.1 Network security management | Basic network controls in place | Limited network security management | High | Enhance network security controls and documentation |
| A.14 System Acquisition, Development and Maintenance | A.14.1 Security requirements of information systems | Security considered but not formalized in development | Lack of security requirements in SDLC | High | Implement secure development lifecycle |
| A.15 Supplier Relationships | A.15.1 Information security in supplier relationships | Limited supplier security assessment | Inadequate supplier security management | Medium | Develop supplier security management program |
| A.16 Information Security Incident Management | A.16.1 Management of information security incidents | Basic incident response | Lack of formal incident management process | High | Develop incident management program |
| A.17 Business Continuity Management | A.17.1 Information security continuity | Limited business continuity planning | Incomplete business continuity planning | High | Develop business continuity plan |
| A.18 Compliance | A.18.1 Compliance with legal and contractual requirements | Some compliance considerations | Incomplete compliance framework | Medium | Implement comprehensive compliance framework |

## Key Findings

1. **Information Security Policies**: No comprehensive information security policy framework exists.
2. **Access Control**: Access control mechanisms exist but lack formal policies and procedures.
3. **Cryptography**: Encryption is used inconsistently across the platform.
4. **Development Security**: Security is considered in development but not formalized in the SDLC.
5. **Incident Management**: No formal incident response plan or procedures are in place.
6. **Business Continuity**: Limited business continuity planning for information security.
7. **Asset Management**: No formal asset inventory or classification system exists.
8. **Supplier Management**: Limited security requirements for third-party suppliers.

## Prioritized Gap Remediation

Based on the identified gaps, the following priorities are recommended:

### High Priority (Next 30 Days)
1. Develop comprehensive information security policy
2. Implement secure development lifecycle procedures
3. Create incident response plan and procedures
4. Establish asset inventory and classification system

### Medium Priority (60-90 Days)
1. Develop access control policies and procedures
2. Implement cryptographic controls policy
3. Establish business continuity planning
4. Create supplier security management program

### Low Priority (90-120 Days)
1. Enhance physical security controls
2. Develop compliance management framework
3. Implement security awareness training program
4. Establish security metrics and reporting

## Next Steps

1. Present findings to management and obtain approval for remediation plan
2. Assign resources and responsibilities for high-priority items
3. Develop project plan for ISO 27001 implementation
4. Begin development of ISMS documentation
5. Schedule follow-up assessment to track progress

## Conclusion

This gap analysis identifies significant areas requiring attention to achieve ISO 27001 compliance. The organization has some security controls in place but lacks a comprehensive ISMS framework. By addressing the identified gaps according to the prioritization plan, SmartRent can systematically work toward ISO 27001 certification.
